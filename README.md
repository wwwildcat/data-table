### Features
- Dataset size selection: small (32 rows) or large (1000 rows).
- Filter settings: filter can be applied on `Apply` button click or on change of input value.
- **Paging**: the table displays no more than 50 rows per page. A number input is used to navigate to the different pages.
- **Sorting**: click on the column header to sort the table by that columnâ€™s value. The first click will sort the data in ascending order, and the second click will then be descending.
- **Filtering**: enter a string into the filter input field, then apply it. The table will display only rows with data that includes the filter string.
- **Add new record**: click on `New record` button to open a form for adding a new record to the table. All fields in the form are required.
- Show additional fields: click on the table row to show additional user information at the bottom of the table.
